Team8InnovAIteHackathon: StudyBuddy

Website Link: https://miguelit07.github.io/StudyBuddy/

This project was created for the InnovAIte Hackathon, hosted by Northeastern University's AI club. This hackathon's assignment was to solve an issue in the education system utilizing AI. Across two days, my group and I collaborated to create the application "StudyBuddy". Our objective with StudyBuddy was to incorporate AI to assist students in organizing their schoolwork, curating study materials, and improving their overall learning experience with tailored support. 

My role was to work on the front end of our application. I utilized HTML, CSS, and JS to create a clean, appealing website that represented our vision for StudyBuddy. Collaborating with teammates working on the back end, I developed an efficient user experience incorporating our ideas/features.

I also lead the created and lead presentation of our project to judges, summarizing our ideas and highlighting key features.
